# Voice Interface
For now, I consider the techniques to implement a voice interface (語音介面) into two parts.
- SLP: core modules that perform the speech language processing
- protocols: the communication protocols requried to build the applications.


# Tools / Applications
[Watson Voice Bot](https://github.com/IBM/watson-voice-bot) IBM chatbot for web browser

[aiortc](https://github.com/aiortc/aiortc) WebRTC and ORTC implementation for Python using asyncio
