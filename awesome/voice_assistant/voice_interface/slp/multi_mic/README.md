# multi-microphone signal processing

## Tools
### [speechbrain.processing.multi-mic module](https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/speechbrain.processing.multi_mic.html)
- Covariance: Computes the covariance matrices of the signals.
- DelaySum: Performs delay and sum beamforming by using the TDOAs and the first channel as a reference.
- GccPhat: Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform localization.
- Gev: Generalized EigenValue decomposition (GEV) Beamforming.
- Music: Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) localization.
- Mvdr: Perform minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming by using an input signal in the frequency domain, its covariance matrices and tdoas (to compute a steering vector).
- SrpPhat: Steered-Response Power with Phase Transform Localization.
