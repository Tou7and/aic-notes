# Phoneme Recognition
Convert Wave to phones.


# From Phoneme Recognition to Speech Recognition
Maybe a well-trained PR model and corresponding P2G model(s) can also work as a good ASR model.

- [Simple and Effective Zero-shot Cross-lingual Phoneme Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11680)
The model leverages the pretrained checkpoint wav2vec2-large-lv60 and is fine-tuned on CommonVoice to recognize phonetic labels in multiple languages.
