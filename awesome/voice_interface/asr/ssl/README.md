## UNISPEECH-SAT
[UNISPEECH-SAT: UNIVERSAL SPEECH REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH SPEAKER AWARE PRE-TRAINING](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05752.pdf)
- integrate our proposed training method in the HuBERT framework
  - utterance-wise contrastive loss
  - utterance-mixing training strategy 
- conduct experiment on Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark (SUPERB)
