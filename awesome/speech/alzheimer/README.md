2020, review
- Language problems are considered one of the most characteristic symptoms of AD
- Primary progressive aphasia (PPA)
- Linguistic tests
  - People with AD have more difficulties in these tests
  - Patterns: repeat the same ideas / less informative / simpler language structures / longer and empty pauses / monotonous prosody
  - Skills for evaluation: identification / comprehension / repetition / reading / Spontaneous Speech (SS)
- Alzheimer’s disease and voice processing
  - The techniques for analysis are very closed to speech emotion recognition
- Conclusion
  - Using ML algorithms to classify linguistic biomarkers through the verbal statements will facilitate the clinical diagnosis of AD
  - There is a need to train the evolving control models on larger data sets
