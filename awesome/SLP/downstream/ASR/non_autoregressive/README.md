# Non-autoregressive ASR
Compared to AR models, NAR models have adventages in decoding speed.


## [IMPROVED MASK-CTC FOR NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE END-TO-END ASR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13270.pdf)
- Contrary to the AR framework, a non-autoregressive (NAR) model generates a sequence within a constant number of the inference steps a non-autoregressive (NAR) model.
